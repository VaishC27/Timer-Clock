# Timer-Clock
In this project, I have used Tkinter module along with dynamic typing concept in Python and build a GUI Application for Timer Clock.
Following the famous POMODORO Technique of time management, I have created an application for countdown timer which can be very useful while you are working and u forget to take breaks from time to time.
the timers that I have manually set in this application are as follows:
  -> 25 mins work
  -> 5 mins short break
  -> 25 mins work
  -> 5 mins short break
  -> 25 mins work
  -> 5 mins short break
  -> 25 mins work
  -> 20 mins long break
You can use the start button to start the timer, Reset button to rest it back. You can modify the timers by editing the code.
I have attached the .png image file for the clock image used in application
